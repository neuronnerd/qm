# Database Connection Error on Render - 2024-02-18

## Incident

A database connection error occurred in production on Render that wasn't present in local development.

```
AttributeError: property 'connection' of '_ConnectionRecord' object has no setter
```

## Root Cause

1. The error occurred due to differences between SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (Render) connection handling:
   - Local development used SQLite which has simpler connection management
   - Render uses PostgreSQL with connection pooling
   - An incorrect connection event handler in `extensions.py` tried to modify read-only connection properties

2. The issue wasn't caught in local development because:
   - SQLite uses different connection management
   - Local testing had fewer concurrent connections
   - The problematic code path wasn't exercised locally

## Resolution

1. Removed problematic connection checkout event handler
2. Added proper PostgreSQL URL format handling (`postgres://` â†’ `postgresql://`)
3. Enhanced connection pool settings
4. Improved error logging for database connection issues

## Changes Made

1. `extensions.py`: Removed problematic connection event handler
2. `settings.py`: Added PostgreSQL URL format conversion
3. `db_utils.py`: Enhanced error handling and logging
4. `config.py`: Improved database configuration management

## Preventive Measures

1. Added better logging around database connections
2. Documented differences between local and production database setups
3. Added connection pool configuration options
4. Implemented proper connection error handling

## Lessons Learned

1. Database connection handling differs significantly between SQLite and PostgreSQL
2. Local development environment should mirror production more closely
3. Connection pooling requires careful configuration and error handling
4. Better logging is crucial for debugging production issues
